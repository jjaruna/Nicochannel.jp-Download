Before starting we must verify that our link is of this style:
https://nicochannel.jp/emoriaya/video/smCcg6JcWAwQqfCq2vpYrK7W

And in order to download the video, you have to comply with these two icons:

# 1.- Download Node.js Current Version.

To start, we will download Node.js in its latest version (Current)

https://nodejs.org/en

You install it in the standard way, and to verify that it is installed, open CMD and type node --version

# 2.- Installing the Minyami tool.

This tool is from Last Order, visit their repository here: https://github.com/Last-Order/Minyami

In the same console where you verified the installation of Node.js, type: 

npm -g i minyami

# 3.- Installing the Minyami browser extension.

To get the download link of our video/live, we will install the following extension for Google Chrome:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minyami/cgejkofhdaffiifhcohjdbbheldkiaed

# 4.- Download the video.

I will take as a reference the first link that I put above. As you can see, there is a free part and a paid part.

Now we will use the google extension that we installed, we can see that we get a "1" as a notification.

Click where it says "Download Live" and press "Copy" in the maximum quality, which in this case is 1280 √ó 720.

With the copied link, we will open a new cmd on the desktop

To do this, open cmd and type: 

cd Desktop 

(Ideally, create a folder to save the videos)

Now we do Ctrl +V, to paste the link in the console and Enter:

# Possible Errors.

I don't know if the program needs FFmpeg, if for some reason it doesn't download as I showed you above, try installing FFmpeg and try doing the steps again.
